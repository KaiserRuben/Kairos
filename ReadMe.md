## What It Can Do Now

The POC demonstrates an intelligent calendar system that helps freelancers and individuals manage their time more effectively:

### 1. Natural Language Scheduling
```bash
# Example of current natural language understanding:
> python calendar_poc.py schedule
> "I need about 2 hours for the mobile app project tomorrow morning"

# The system understands and suggests optimal slots based on:
- Project context
- Your usual work patterns
- Available free time
- Energy levels throughout the day
```

### 2. Project Awareness
Currently tracks three sample projects showing how it:
- Remembers what you were last working on
- Knows each project's current phase and next steps
- Understands how much time you've invested
- Suggests scheduling based on project priorities

### 3. Smart Analysis
The `analyze` command provides insights about:
- How you spend your time
- Project progress tracking
- Potential schedule optimizations
- Work patterns and suggestions

### 4. Intelligent Scheduling
- Finds optimal time slots for tasks
- Prevents context switching
- Protects focus time
- Manages breaks effectively
- Handles recurring events

### Current Limitations
- Command line interface only
- No data persistence (resets on restart)
- No calendar sync
- Limited to basic scheduling scenarios
- No mobile access

## User Interface Design


### Key Interface Patterns

1. **Natural Language Input**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>+Interface: Types "2 hours for client work"
    Interface->>+LLM: Process request
    LLM-->>-Interface: Structured interpretation
    Interface->>+User: Shows interpretation
    User->>+Interface: Confirms/Adjusts
    Interface->>+Calendar: Schedules event
    Calendar-->>-Interface: Confirmation
    Interface-->>-User: Visual feedback
```

2. **Smart Scheduling Flow**
The interface should guide users through a natural scheduling flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Natural Language Input] -->|Parse| B[Show Interpretation]
    B -->|Confirm| C[Display Options]
    C -->|Select| D[Schedule Event]
    C -->|Adjust| B
    D -->|Success| E[Visual Feedback]
```
